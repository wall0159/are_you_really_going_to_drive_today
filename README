This repository contains:
PDF copy of our presentation: 
Are you really going to drive today.pdf

R-code used to develop the models of traffic congestion vs rain, and also the maps containing the skewness of congestion data (the degree to which motor vehicle commuter times are highly sensitive to increased traffic volumes):
createMaps.R

archived exploraty Matlab code (now deprecated)
legacy Matlab code

Excel spreadsheet of our cost anlaysis for Brisbane commuter options -- investigating the costs of different transport modalities.
summary data for charts.xlsx
Commuter scenario rules and trip calculator.xlsx

Downloaded datasets to allow replication of our work:

Provides an argument for our solution -- namely, that a combination of public transport and information services provides much better value than building more car infrastructure
